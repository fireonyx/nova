# Stack Variables and Allocation #
It's important that you have a good concept for the memory stack and heap.

```asm
boot:
    sub(sp, 1); // Subtract 1 from the stack pointer.
    move(&sp, 17); // Write the decimal number, 17 to the address stored in `sp`.
    
    // Deallocate the variable.
    move(&sp, 0); // Optional to clear the variable.
    add(sp, 1); // Move the stack pointer back to where it started.
 ```
